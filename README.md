This repository serves as an online git-based portfolio for my works in the fields of computer science and programming. 

Each smaller file within the larger repository has an individual README file written in markdown that is meant to describe that specific project and give a concise summary of it.

For a larger explanation of a specific project, see the pdf included within that project's file.
