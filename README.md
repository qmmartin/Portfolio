# Portfolio Repository
Welcome to my online portfolio, showcasing my works in computer science and programming. This repository is organized to provide you with easy access to my various projects and their details.

## Structure
Each project within this repository has its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find a README file written in Markdown. These README files provide a concise summary of the project, detailing its purpose, functionality, and any other relevant information.
